## Hi, I’m Nate McGraw

I’m a cybersecurity professional actively pursuing a **penetration testing or red team role**, with a strong focus on **real-world attacker tradecraft, Active Directory exploitation, and adversary emulation**.

I hold the **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** and a Bachelor’s degree in **Cybersecurity and Information Assurance** from Western Governors University. I’m currently **preparing for the Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** exam, with a focus on advanced Active Directory tradecraft, Kerberos abuse, and post-exploitation techniques.

My background spans SOC operations, vulnerability research, and hands-on offensive security across Windows, Linux, cloud, and Active Directory environments.

## What I Focus On

My primary interests and strengths are in **offensive security and red team operations**, including:

- Active Directory attacks (Kerberos, ADCS, trusts, delegation, lateral movement)
- Internal network compromise and multi-hop pivoting
- Privilege escalation on Windows and Linux
- Credential access and abuse (hashes, tickets, certificates)
- Adversary emulation aligned with real-world attack paths

I spend a significant amount of time in **labs and CTFs**, deliberately chaining vulnerabilities together rather than treating issues in isolation. This site documents those attack paths and the reasoning behind them.

## Professional Experience

Most recently, I worked as a **Cybersecurity Analyst at Zyston**, where I monitored and investigated security events for **50+ client environments** across multiple industries. On a typical day, I handled dozens of investigations involving SIEM, EDR, and cloud telemetry, with a strong emphasis on determining true positives and escalating meaningful incidents.

That experience sharpened my ability to:
- Identify attacker behavior quickly
- Understand how detection gaps are created
- Evaluate exploitability and impact from both offensive and defensive perspectives

Earlier in my career, I worked as a **full-stack developer with a front-end focus**, primarily building modern **React.js applications** backed by secure APIs. My work emphasized:

- Designing and implementing secure React front-ends
- Consuming and integrating authenticated APIs
- Implementing client-side input validation and secure data handling
- Working closely with backend services (Ruby on Rails) to enforce authentication, authorization, and business logic

This development background informs my offensive security work by giving me a strong understanding of how real applications are built — and how they are commonly misconfigured or exposed.

Before that, I supported large government environments as a **Help Desk Analyst**, managing identity, access controls, and user permissions at scale.

## Offensive Security & Research

I maintain a hands-on offensive skillset and have disclosed multiple vulnerabilities publicly, including **CVE-2024-42849** and **CVE-2024-42850**.

Certifications and training that best reflect my current focus include:

- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO) — in progress**
- Certified AppSec Practitioner (CAP)
- CompTIA Security+, CySA+, Network+
- Linux Essentials

I prioritize **practical exploitation and understanding** over checklists, and I continuously refine my methodology through labs, tooling, and self-directed research.

## This Site

This site serves as a **technical portfolio and learning journal**. You’ll find:

- Detailed CTF and lab write-ups focused on realistic attack paths
- Notes on Active Directory exploitation and post-exploitation tradecraft
- Tooling experiments, environment setup, and tunneling techniques
- Reflections on offensive security learning and methodology

Everything here is written to demonstrate *how I think as an operator*, not just what tools I can run.

## Open to Opportunities

I am **actively seeking opportunities** in **penetration testing, red team, or adversary emulation** roles where I can continue developing as an operator and contribute meaningful findings.

If you’re hiring for offensive security roles or want to discuss tradecraft, I’m always open to a conversation.
